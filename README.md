# Classical Tetris written in C++

This is a simple Tetris game written in C++ using the raylib library. 
The game is fully functional and has a simple GUI. The game is controlled using the arrow keys.
Note that this is Classical Tetris, so no holds or holding arrow keys to move the piece down faster. Pure **NES style** Tetris.
